"""Routing and request handler for REST API

The flask app object provides the route decorator to dispatch requests
to the function as described in the decorator argument as well as controlling
the valid HTTP verbs that can be requested to that endpoint. The decorated
handler expects a flask.Response object as the return value.

See http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/quickstart/#about-responses for how
flask converts return values to Response objects.
